# PySalViz

project for Marynia Kolak, 
Advanced Spatial Stats, Spring 2016

##Goals:

1. Organize viz notebooks in coherent and updatable way
(Proposed solution: dynamic web application with tagged notebooks, scrapers, and calls)

2. Check out interactive viz options, compare, and report.
Prelim findings: keep as python or convert to javascript (matplotlib, plotly, mpld3)
Types of interaction: zoom, resize, hover and data pop-up, linked brushing across graphs and maps
Need to: show options in one or a few notebooks, for example

3. Develop a solid notebook with full features: linked moran plot and LISA map with prelim ESDA

## Beyond 

Consider modules and service requests
