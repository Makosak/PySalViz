# PySalViz

project for Marynia Kolak, 
Advanced Spatial Stats, Spring 2016


## Deliverables:

0. <a href="https://github.com/Makosak/PySalViz/blob/master/PySAL%20Project%20Final%20(M.Kolak).pdf"> Final Project Review </a> (Presentation)

1. <a href="http://pysal.github.io/notebooks"> PySal Notebook Gallery </a> (Web Application)

<b> Note: </b> Look at the <a href="https://github.com/pysal/notebooks/tree/gh-pages">"Read ME"</a> file at the PySal Notebook Gallery page (on the gh-branch of Pysal Notebooks) for instructions on how to contribute to the notebook gallery.

2. <a href="https://github.com/Makosak/PySalViz/blob/master/Interactive%20Visualization%20Comparison.ipynb">  Visualization Exploration: Interactive Maps and Plots in iPython Notebooks </a> (iPy Notebook) 

<b> Note: </b> Interactive graphics will not render in Github-hosted version of notebook. Please view iPy notebook on your machine with required kernel.

3. Moran Plot graphing function (python file, iPy Notebook)



## Goals:

1. Organize viz notebooks in coherent and updatable way.(Proposed solution: dynamic web application with tagged notebooks, scrapers, and calls)

2. Check out interactive viz options, compare, and report. 

Prelim findings: keep as python or convert to javascript (matplotlib, plotly, mpld3). 

Types of interaction: zoom, resize, hover and data pop-up, linkedb rushing across graphs and maps. 

Need to: show options in one or a few notebooks, for example.

*Maplotlib* notebook extension:
- automates interactive within notebook
- requires kernel
- resizing and zoom works
- hover, pop-up, linked brushing not options?

3. Develop a solid notebook with full features: linked moran plot and LISA map with prelim ESDA.

## Beyond 

Consider modules and service requests
