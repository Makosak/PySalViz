    "### Review and Indexing of Visualization Notebooks\n",
    "First, I will review, in depth, existing PySal Vizualization module code to identify the state of work. Multiple Notebooks have recently been added to the module;  I will review, replicate, and index their locations and visualization atributes. Some of these notebooks are not connected to the module directly, so this will take priority. (See vizualization-relevant notebooks <a href=\"https://github.com/pysal/notebooks/tree/master/notebooks\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/pysal/notebooks?files=1\">here</a>.) Following this review, I will further refine next benchmarks as needed. \n",

    "<li> Directional LISA with rose diagram </li>\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to build on previous work by PySal developers\n",
    "I am particularly interested in improving matplotlib functionalities for notebook visualizations, and interested in further connecting aspects of plotly, folium, or other tools to enhance interactive capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeframe: March - April 2015\n",
    "\n",
    "### PySAL Visualization API \n",
    "Following these, I am also very working on operationalizing features of the visualization module to integrate in dynamic environments. This may serve as an interplay with existing javascript and python libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "The API would be tested in an ASU Chainbuilder environment for system architecture and workflow integration. I would like to use a web application prototype (currently served as http://makosak.github.io/chihealthaccess) as a testing interface for dynamic web app integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be beyond the scope of this class, but I hope to at least establish a solid framework for future API development.\n",
